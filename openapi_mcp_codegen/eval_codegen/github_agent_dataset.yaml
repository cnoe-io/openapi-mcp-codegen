      GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform that allows you to automate workflows directly in your GitHub repository. It uses YAML files to define workflows that can be triggered by various events like pushes, pull requests, or schedules. Workflows consist of jobs that run on virtual machines and can perform tasks like testing, building, and deploying code.
